# tuifw-screen

Text User Interface Framework. Intended to abstract over ncurses/notcurses/win console API/DOS text mode/etc.

Basic platform-independent text screen implementation. Uses [tuifw-screen-winapi](https://crates.io/crates/tuifw-screen-winapi) and [tuifw-screen-ncurses](https://crates.io/crates/tuifw-screen-ncurses) as backend.
